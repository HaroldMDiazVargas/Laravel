First Laravel App

    Creating app:
     1. We create a new folder in our linux subsystem 
     2. Once in the folder, we can run:
       curl -s https://laravel.build/appName | bash
       - This may takes several minutes.
       - This will create our Laravel app in a folder with the name of our app,
       - Will install Sail and build Sail's app container on our local machine
       


    Running our Laravel app:
     1. We head over to our project folder
     2. Run:
        ❯ ./vendor/bin/sail up
        - This will start Laravel Sail
        - Laravel Sail provides a simple CLI interface for interactiwh with 
          Laravel's default Docker configuration
     Notes: In case we run our laravel app we can get error maybe for PORT conflicts
            Usually MySQL takes 3306, so is better stop this service before run our
            Laravel app!
     3. View our app: http://localhost/
    


    Shell Alias our sail command:
     - We have seen that to run Laravel Sail we need to run a weird command
     - Instead we can configurate an alias to make this easier:
       1. Open our bash using vim editor:
          ❯ vim ~/.bashrc (RECOMMENDED)
          ❯ vim ~/.zshrc
          Can be whatever of both
       2. Paste the next command and save(Esc + :wq):
          ❯ alias sail up='[ -f sail ] && sh sail || sh vendor/bin/sail'
       3. Source the file to allow the alias takes effects
          ❯ source ~/.bashrc
       4. Restart terminal
       5. Head over project folder and run
         ❯ sail commandName
         ❯ sail up => This will execute our laravel app
    
    sail artisan:
     - This is a CLI interface provided by Laravel
     - To see all list of artisan commnads
       ❯ sail artisan list
       Some useful we will use:
       - migrate
       - make:controler
