MVC Architecture
    Definition:
     - Laravel is based on this Architecture
     - Deal with apps to split them into three boxes
    
    MVC Architecture:
     Models:
      - Contains all the logic related to the app data:
        - schemas
        - databases
        - ..
      - Here we write the part to intereact with the database
     Views:
      - Contains the user interface
      - All component we see in web page
     Controllers:
      - Connects what the Models with the Views

    Summary:
     - User interacts with the webpage => View
     - Controller takes input from view, uses some logic to translate 
       that input into a request for Model
     - Model then grabs data from database
     - Controller passes data to view => update the view
    
    Benefits:
     - Maintain app easy to maintain
     - Avoid code repetition
