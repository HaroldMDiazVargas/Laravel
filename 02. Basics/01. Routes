Handling Routing:
    routes/
     - On this dolder we have by defaylt 4 php files
     - The one we're interested at begin in "web.php"
       - On this we have definition of our routes!
    
    Creating a new get route:
     - We create by using "Route class" and in this class we have a static method 
       called:
       - get(), which takes:
         - "route"
         -  handlerFundction => Thils will return our view!
    

    View:
     - Our view can be an external view file, but here for now we can just return 
       basic html markup
    



-- routes/web.php
<?php

use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;


Route::get('/', function () {
    return view('welcome');
});

Route::get('/home', function () {
    return "<h1>Home page<h1>";
});
