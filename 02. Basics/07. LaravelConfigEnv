Laravel Env Config
    Definition:
     - Every app needs different values needs to be access through different apps:
       - app name
       - credentials
       - database url
       - ...
    
    .env file:
     - This is added by Laravel in root of app
     - This has variables as:
       - APP_NAME
       - APP_ENV
       - APP_KEY
       - APP_DEBUG
       - APP_URL=http://localhost ()
       - ...
     - This file is part of .gitignore for security reasons, and every person in our 
       team will have different set of config values

    .env.example:
     - This is shared with our collaborators as a template to re-use by all members

    config/:
     - In this folder we catch the values from .env file
     - Here we have several files, where we use:
       env("keyName", "valueAsDefault")
       This means:
       - If keyName is false and doesn't contain a value, it will take the default value
     - In all this files the purpose is to export names we used to catch through our app

    Access config variables values in our markup:
     - We can access using config() and passing the variable we want to retrieve:
       e.g config("fileName.varName")
       e.g <title> {{ config("app.name") }}</title>
